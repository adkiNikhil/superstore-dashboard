## Key Business Insights

- **Profitability:** Identified that while the 'Furniture' category drives high revenue, it suffers from the lowest profit margins (-15% in specific regions).
- **Customer Segmentation:** Implemented RFM logic to classify the top 25% of customers as "Champions," allowing for targeted loyalty programs.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core logic and data manipulation.
- **Pandas:** Data cleaning, date parsing, and aggregation.
- **Streamlit:** Interactive web application framework.
- **Plotly:** Dynamic data visualization.
